<hr/>

Video editing software focused on motion effects and versatility.

In addition to basic cut editing and animation, sound mixing, extension external library, project management, and text editing features, we provide many functions.

Also, it provides layer-based editing. It is different from track-based editing. It has the advantage of being easy to add multiple effects to each asset.
